      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        This is just a silly app written for fun. It is not meant to actually decide a 
        language for you. Each programming language has its own strengths and weaknesses
        and you should probably just use the language you enjoy most or the one that is 
        best for the job!
      </p>

      <h2>The Code</h2>
      <p>
        This app was created with just plain old JavaScript, html, CSS, and Gimp. You 
        can view the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tylerd81/wheel-spinny">code repository here</a>.
